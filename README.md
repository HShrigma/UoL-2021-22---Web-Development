My work features 3 folders fulfilling 2 purposes:
1.-2. - Midterm Work. This was a team project to provide HTML & CSS. You can find the HTML files in the "HTML_Files" folder and my report in the "Midterm" folder respectively.
3. - "Final Project" - A solo job where I was tasked to create a website using only HTML, CSS, & Javascript. Both implementation and report featured.
