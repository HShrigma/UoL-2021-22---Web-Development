                    giving you a little headstart if you are too anxious to show up.<br> Note: Due to medical concerns
                    and the uncertainty of the current pandemic, we operate fully through our Discord server, where we

            </div>
            <div class="about_text">
                <p>Fighting games are a video game genre, where 2 or more players face off, trying to eliminate each
                    other until one winning player or team emerges.<br>They come in all shapes and sizes - 2D, 3D, one
                    versus one, team-based, etc.<br> In most games, the flow of a match revolves around 2 players
                    launching and blocking attacks. Failing to block an attack results in receiving damage. Once someone
                    has taken enough damage to deplete their life bar - the match ends.

                <p>Well, short answer - because they are fun. Long answer:<br>Although they sound simple, the underlying
                    mechanics and human versus human element makes even the simplest of games a complex mind
                    game.<br>From mastering the mechanical inputs to game tactics and mental tricks for playing against
                    other people, fighting games are an endless journey of improvement!<br>Fighting games are a major
                    cornerstone of competitive gaming and arguably the pioneer of modern eSports!<br>This complexity can
                    be daunting to beginners, therefore our website also has a guide for beginners.<br> Our major goal
                    is to get even someone who has never touched a fighting game in

            <div class="about_text">
                <p>Street Fighter 5 is what we call a "Fundamental Fighter". It is a great place for beginners to learn,
                    inputs are mostly easy to perform, <a>combos</a> are short, and the victor is usually the person
                    with the
                    strongest base
                    skills in game. <br> While modern fighting games are usually well-balanced, many have complex inputs
                    or movement systems, long combos, and game systems that may be confusing or distracting to
                    beginners.<br>Street Fighter has remained the series easiest to learn, but still hard to
                    master.<br>And if you have followed us so far - there is no such thing as mastering a fighting game,
                    it is always a journey of improvement!</p>
